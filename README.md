(Ml).
In my data visualization project,I likely used (Python) libraries such as:

Matplotlib – for basic 2D plots like line graphs, bar charts, and scatter plots.
Seaborn – for enhanced statistical visualizations.
Plotly – for interactive visualizations, including 3D plots.
Bokeh – for web-based interactive plots.
Altair – for declarative, easy-to-use statistical visualization.
Pandas – for simple plotting and handling data frames.
